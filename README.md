# A Pair of Templates for Job Applications.
## Designed by Vivek Hazari, Inspired by Principles from Matthew Butterick.

Support Butterick here: [Practical Typography]().

Using these templates directly requires an installation of XeLaTeX, and the purchase of Butterick's fonts.

If you do not want to support Butterick, I would reccomend Helvetica Neue and Charter as alternatives to the fonts used.
