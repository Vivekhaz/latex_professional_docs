Dear Ms. Montagano,

I'm writing to open a dialogue on the Investment Analyst position at Citigroup. My course of study in Computer Science and Philosophy reflects Citi's focus; I am pursuing the deepest technical knowledge, along with the a rigorous understanding of the problems I work on.

In my internship as a Data Scientist with Lovingly, a SaaS startup, I honed my ability to focus on what matters. For me, my job was to worry about the details, so the rest of the team could focus on building the product. When the Technical Lead of the company asked me to quantify the value of one of the directives that operations had newly introduced, I went further. I used the previous year of data to quantify all of the companies directives. While intuitive, many of operations' directives were actually losing the company money. The Technical Lead asked me to present my findings to the CEO and managing partners. I communicated the key points of the company's financial performance in a sea of quantitative noise. This is a clarity and focus I can bring to Citi.

I dealt first hand with the requirements of a upcoming business while working with the co-founders of TaxPat. I validated their pitch, doing the ground work and research to ensure there was a profitable business model in the industry they intended to enter. They estimated their market size as a quarter of a million immigrants. I dug through U.S. and Indian immigration statistics, discovering they had overlooked hundreds of thousands of potential customers. I know statistics only tell part of the story, so I went further. I reached out to contacts of the co-founders, as well as my own, to investigate the potential for their product. My market-sizing research showed there were close to half a million immigrants in their target demographic. After updating their pitch deck with our updated market size, the co-founders secured funding.

The consistent thread in my experience has a focus on the micro, to support the macro. I believe this reflects the values of Citi, where pushing epistemic bounds is a requirement. I appreciate your taking the time to look over my application, and look forward to hearing back from you so we can discuss a potential opportunity to work as a Analyst Intern at Citi.
